# FedSegment

##  A Federated Learning Framework for Image Segmentation

### Our project is in collaboration with FedML, a research library and benchmark for federated machine learning, developed at USC. Our module will be an open source contribution to FedML. 


### Overview

Image segmentation is a commonly used technique to partition an image and generate pixel-wise masks for each instance. There are several interesting use cases for segmentation, ranging from medical data analysis to content-based image retrieval. 

However, is it possible to do image segmentation on data we do not have access to?
No, not now! 

Does that limit us to solve problems we care about?
Maybe, yes. 

Let us consider a scenario where top medical institutions have just learned about the novel coronavirus and intend to diagnose the illness using the chest X-ray images of symptomatic patients. Using these images, a segmentation model could be developed in order to facilitate early diagnosis. Unfortunately, this approach is not as straightforward as it sounds. We would inevitably encounter some significant bottlenecks while training the segmentation model. The most noteworthy concern would be data insufficiency due to privacy concerns where hospitals are unwilling to share sensitive patient records, besides lack of adequate computing resources.
